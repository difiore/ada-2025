The goal of Bayesian stats and Bayesian inference is fundamentally different than that of frequentist statistics and inference. Rather than estimating the probability of our data being generated, by chance, from a particular "null" model as in classical null hypothesis significance testing, the Bayesian approach is instead concerned with evaluating the probability of alternative models for generating the data, given the data that we have (and given certain prior information about possible models).
