p value is simply the probability of seeing some descriptive statistic (mean, median, regression coefficient, whatever) with the data you have *given particular assumptions you make about the model generating the data*; it says nothing about effect size, biological meaning. or the accuracy of the model. i don't see a problem with *reporting* p values... the concern is using the p value as a line for a dichotomous

statistical significance does not mean the effect is strong

it's valuable also, I think, to contrast p values based on the classical/Fisherian frequentist approach where the "model" is that the data come from some well-characterized mathematical distributions (Gaussian, binomial, etc.) versus p values based on permutation/resampling from the particular data we have collected; that latter is much more relevant for the situation that most of us face, where we often don't have a good idea about the data generating model

the goal of Bayesian stats and Bayesian inference is fundamentally different than that of frequentist stats and inference... the Bayesian approach is to evaluate the probability of alternative models for generating data, given the data that you have (and given prior information about possible models)
