# https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/378939/dealing-with-singular-fit-in-mixed-models
# "When you obtain a singular fit, this is often indicating that the model is overfitted â€“ that is, the random effects structure is too complex to be supported by the data, which naturally leads to the advice to remove the most complex part of the random effects structure (usually random slopes). The benefit of this approach is that it leads to a more parsimonious model that is not over-fitted."
