# Exercise 12 {.unnumbered}

# Practice Model Selection {.unnumbered}

## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

- Run exploratory multivariate regression to evaluate different models

#### Preliminaries {.unnumbered}

- Set up a new ***GitHub*** repo in your ***GitHub*** workspace named "exercise-12" and clone that down to your computer as a new ***RStudio*** project. The instructions outlined as **Method 1** in [**Module 6**](#module-06) will be helpful.
- Using the {tidyverse} `read_tsv()` function, load the "Mammal_lifehistories_v2.txt" dataset from [this URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-2024-datasets/main/Mammal_lifehistories_v2.txt) as a "tibble" named **d**. As discussed in class, this is dataset that compiles life history and other variables for over 1400 species of placental mammals from 17 different Orders.

> **Data source**:
>
> Ernest SKM. (2003). Life history characteristics of placental nonvolant mammals. *Ecology* 84: 3402â€“3402.

- Do a bit of exploratory data analysis with this dataset, e.g., using the {skimr} package. Which of the variables are categorical and which are numeric?

## Challenge {.unnumbered}
#### Step 1 {.unnumbered}

- Replace all values of -999 (the authors' code for missing data) with `NA`.

> **HINT:** This is easy to do in base {R}, but you can also check out the `replace_with_na_all()` function from the {naniar} package.

#### Step 2 {.unnumbered}

- Drop the variables **litter size** and **refs**.

#### Step 3 {.unnumbered}

- Log transform all of the other numeric variables.

> **HINT:** There are lots of ways to do this... look into `mutate(across(where(), .funs))` for an efficient motif.

#### Step 4 {.unnumbered}

- Regress the (now log transformed) *age* [**gestation(mo)**, **weaning(mo)**, **AFR(mo)** (i.e., age at first reproduction), and **max. life(mo)** (i.e., maximum lifespan)] and *mass* [**newborn(g)** and **wean mass(g)**] variables on (now log transformed) overall body **mass(g)** and add the residuals to the dataframe as new variables [**relGest**, **relWean**, **relAFR**, **relLife**, **relNewbornMass**, and **relWeaningMass**].

> **HINT:** Use "na.action=na.exclude" in your`lm()` calls. With this argument set, the residuals will be padded to the correct length by inserting NAs for cases with missing data.

#### Step 5 {.unnumbered}

- Plot residuals of max lifespan (**relLife**) in relation to **Order**. Which mammalian orders have the highest residual lifespan?
- Plot residuals of newborn mass (**relNewbornMass**) in relation to **Order**. Which mammalian orders have the have highest residual newborn mass?
- Plot residuals of weaning mass (**relWeaningMass**) in relation to **Order**. Which mammalian orders have the have highest residual weaning mass?

> **NOTE:** There will be lots of missing data for the latter two variables!

#### Step 6 {.unnumbered}

- Run models and a model selection process to evaluate what (now log transformed) variables best predict each of the two response variables, **max. life(mo)** and **AFR(mo)**, from the set of the following predictors: **gestation(mo)**, **newborn(g)**, **weaning(mo)**, **wean mass(g)**, **litters/year**, and overall body **mass(g)**.

> **HINT:** Before running models, winnow your dataset to drop rows that are missing the respective response variable or any of the predictors, e.g., by using `drop_na()`.

- For each of the two response variables, indicate what is the best model overall based on AICc and how many models have a delta AICc of 4 or less?
- What variables, if any, appear in all of this set of "top" models?
- Calculate and plot the model-averaged coefficients and their CIs across this set of top models.
